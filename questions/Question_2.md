Explain some **Pros & Cons** in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, **Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat**

- We can keep the stack to one programming language
- Way less architecture, dependencies, syntaxes etc.
- Easy way to deploy PWA and even desktop applications with electron.js

**Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; middleware.**  
Middleware in express takes incoming requests, does something to them and passes them on to the next middleware in the chain before returning the request.

```javascript
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  req.foo = "bar";
  next();
});
```

In this example "bar" is added to req.foo and next() is called and the request is sent on.

Instead of "Foo" the function could handle logging, authentication, cors and much more.  
In this example, we use a logger to log when the facade is initialized and

```javascript
// Initialize facade using the database set on the application object
router.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  if (!facade) {
    const db = req.app.get("db");
    req.app
      .get("logger")
      .log("info", `Database used: ${req.app.get("db-type")}`);
    facade = new FriendFacade(db);
  }
  next();
});
```

**Explain a setup for Express/Node/Test/Mongo-DB/GraphQL development with Typescript. Focus on how it uses Mongo-DB (how secret values are handled, how connections (production or test) are passed on to relevant places in code, and if used, how authentication and authorization is handled**  
Check the start code.

Explain shortly about GraphQL, its purpose and some of its use cases

Explain shortly about GraphQLâ€™s type system and some of the benefits we get from this

Explain shortly about GraphQL Schema Definition Language, and provide examples of schemas you have defined

Provide a number of examples demonstrating; creating, updating and deleting with Mutations. You should provide examples both running in a Sandbox/playground and examples executed in an Apollo Client.
